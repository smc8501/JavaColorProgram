# JavaColorProgram

This project was part of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science Year 1 Data Structures and Algorithms Coursework.

The objectives of this project were:
* To compare the time complexities for different data structures such as lists, tree sets and maps and hash sets and maps by creating those data structures to store the number of distinct colours on each image generated by the program as values.
* To use a frequency map to store distinct colours as keys and the number of pixels of that colour in the image as values and then have a visual representation of the colours that each image used.
